### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js** (v20.x or higher) - [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. **npm** - Comes bundled with Node.js (version 10.x or higher).
3. A backend server running (refer to the [backend repository](../backend/README.md) for setting up the API).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zernabhussain/cake-lover-app-suite
   cd cake-lover-app-suite/frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. If you're using a backend API, ensure it's running on `http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT`.

## Usage

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development

During development, you can make changes to the code, and the application will automatically reload in the browser. You can also check for linting issues using:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` directory with the production-ready files.

## Testing

To run tests, you can use:

```bash
npm test
```
